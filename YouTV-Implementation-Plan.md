# Task Description
Implement a project similar to LibreTV based on the GitHub repository at https://github.com/YOUYCG/LibreTV. The project should include TV channel streaming functionality, user interface for browsing and selecting channels, and follow modern web development best practices.

# Project Overview
LibreTV is a lightweight, free online video search and streaming platform that provides content search and playback services from multiple video sources. It's built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and uses Node.js/Express for backend proxy functionality.
